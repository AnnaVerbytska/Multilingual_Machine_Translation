      "1. **Key Points:** The text emphasizes two important civic duties: participating in public discussions and voting. The goal is to achieve fair policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Simplifying:** The Spanish is already relatively simple, but we can make it even more direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Vocabulary Adaptation:** Choose everyday words that Polish workers and their families in Spain (with a B1 Spanish level) would understand. Avoid complicated grammatical structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Accuracy and Clarity:** Ensure the translation reflects the meaning of the original text accurately and is easily understood.\n",

      "**Final Translation:**\n",

      "**Explanation of Choices:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   \"Obywatele\" (Citizens) is a direct and commonly understood translation.\n",
      "*   \"Powinni braƒá udzia≈Ç\" (Should take part) is a simple way to express the obligation.\n",
      "*   \"w rozmowach o wa≈ºnych sprawach\" (in conversations about important matters) avoids the more formal term for \"public discussions\" and makes it more approachable.\n",
      "*   \"i g≈Çosowaƒá\" (and vote) is a clear and direct translation.\n",
      "*   \"≈ºeby wybraƒá dobre zasady\" (to choose good rules/policies) avoids complex phrasing and uses simpler vocabulary. \"Zasady\" is a very common word for rules/policies.\n",
